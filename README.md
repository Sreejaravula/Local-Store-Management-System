# Comprehensive Store Management System

## Overview
The Comprehensive Store Management System is a robust application designed to streamline and manage all aspects of a retail store. It provides features for inventory management, sales tracking, customer management, and reporting.

- **Digitized Billing**: Digitized hundreds of unreliable paper-based bills, enhancing reliability, security, and ease of management.
- **Dynamic Tagging System**: Allows the store owner to create, pin/unpin, and delete tags, which can be assigned to products for easy filtering and navigation.
- **Comprehensive Billing Module**: Supports multiple customers per bill, multiple phone numbers per customer, and automated bill status classification (Paid, Unpaid, Partially Paid) based on payment history.
